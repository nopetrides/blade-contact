    /// rotates through another between two simulation steps can exchange sides while both endpoint poses
    /// are separated. Conservative advancement is angular-capable: at each iterate it measures the true
    /// surface separation and advances time by only what an upper bound on the closure rate permits,
    /// so no contact earlier than the returned time of impact can exist along the interpolated path.
    ///
    /// The closure bound for the requested motion is
    /// <c>|dPositionA - dPositionB| + angleA * extentA + angleB * extentB</c>,
    /// which bounds the rate of change of the distance between any spine point of A and any of B.
    /// It is deliberately loose rather than tight: looseness costs iterations, never correctness.

    /// registered swords remain dynamic Rigidbodies owned by Unity.
