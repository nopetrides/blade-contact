///     <para>
///         Eligibility is a property of the SWORD, declared where the sword is. Nothing here knows about
///         bays, stations, test pairs or which swords are expected to meet: a contact is handled when
///         BOTH colliders in it belong to registered blades, whoever they are. That is what lets the same
///         component serve a servo-driven station sword, an XRI-grabbable sword, a freestanding target,
///         and ordinary sword-vs-sword play without configuration.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         PhysX is NOT suppressed. The blade colliders collide normally; the solver adds a tangential
///         term on top of whatever PhysX already does. Guard, grip, pommel, world and any contact where
///         one side is unregistered stay entirely with ordinary PhysX.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Collider <see cref="PhysicsMaterial"/> values are never written by this system. A sword can be
///         touching several things at once, and a collider-wide material cannot express one behaviour per
///         contact; writing it would silently change every other contact that collider is in.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>The blade is not always where it was authored.</b> An attachment system can re-host a
///         sword's physics on a rigid copy, leaving the authored collider disabled and the authored body
///         kinematic. Everything here therefore goes through <see cref="BladeShell.ActiveColliders"/>,
///         <see cref="BladeShell.ActiveBody"/> and <see cref="BladeShell.ActiveTransform"/>, and the
///         registration is rebuilt whenever that binding changes. Holding the authored collider instead
///         fails silently: contacts arrive on shapes nothing recognises, no pair is ever formed, and the
///         blade behaves as ordinary PhysX with no error anywhere.
